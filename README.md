### Notes
The bigest challenges in this unit was having the recycler view show my data properly. I ended up having to place the title above the picture instead of to the right of the image. This allowed the app to run great and look good in the end but it was a pain to set up. Another issue was implementing the adapter methods. I had to change some of the lables on the created cunstructors to continue. I also had issues getting a Json response and had to remake the app from scratch to find my error, yikes. I plan to keep working on it to make it better before the submission time.
